# Spinner pattern wave 🍃

Experimenting with CSS to create an interactive pattern. 


### How is works
- The grid is made up of spinning circles or spinners
- Each spinner uses a conic-gradient background to make a 4-quartered circle
- Each 360 degree rotation goes from transitions from 0 to 1 in opacity
- The varied delay creates the wave effect
- The overall speed is controlled by the slider
