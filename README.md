# Interactive wave pattern 🍃

Experimenting with CSS animation to create an interactive wave pattern. 

### How it works ⚙️
- The grid is made up of spinning circles or spinners
- Each spinner uses a conic-gradient background to make a 4-quartered circle
- With each 360 degree rotation the opacity transitions from 0 to 1
- The varied animation delay creates the wave effect
- The overall speed and colours are controlled by the sliders
